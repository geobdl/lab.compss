## Applications

### [Emotion Sense](http://www.emotionsense.org/)

"Emotion Sense is an Android application that lets you explore how
your mood relates to the data that your smartphone can invisibly
capture as you carry it throughout the day."

### [Purple Robot](http://tech.cbits.northwestern.edu/purple-robot/)

From CBITs [Center for Behavioral Intervention
Technologies](http://cbits.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern
University.

"... provides the following major features for constructing
context-aware interventions and experiences: A full real-time sensor
data acquisition platform for collecting information about the user
and their immediate surroundings...Robust Javascript & Scheme
scripting engines...A robust store-and-forward architecture for
transmitting sensor data and user-provided information to custom data
warehouses...A full trigger framework for defining conditions when
scripted actions should occur."

"Android app for providing automation and management services to apps
not supporting the full Android feature set (background processing,
notifications, etc.)."

## Libraries and Frameworks

* [X-Sense Labs](https://github.com/xsenselabs) - the libraries behind the Emotion Sense application
  * [ES Sensor Library](https://github.com/xsenselabs/SensorManager) "An Android Library that offers an easy way to access one-off and publish/subscribe interface to all the smartphone sensors. For more details, check the documentation."
  * [ES Data Manager Library](https://github.com/xsenselabs/SensorDataManager) "An Android Library that allows you to store and bulk transfer sensor (or other application) data, based on the connectivity requirements of your application."
  * [ES Trigger Manager Librar](https://github.com/xsenselabs/TriggerManager) "An Android Library that to notify your application when particular events happen. These triggers can be based on time (e.g., on a particular interval or randomly over a given period) or on sensor events (e.g., a call was received or the phone is moving)."
* [Funf Open Sensing Framework](http://www.funf.org/about.html) by
Behavio (acquired by Google): "an extensible sensing and data
processing framework for mobile devices, originally developed at the
MIT Media Lab. The core concept is to provide an open source, reusable
set of functionalities, enabling the collection, uploading, and
configuration of a wide range of data types."
* [GAST](https://github.com/gast-lib/gast-lib)
* [MyExperience](http://myexperience.sourceforge.net/) "MyExperience is a context-aware data collection platform for
capturing objective and subjective data as it's experienced." Windows Mobile only.
