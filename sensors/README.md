## Applications

### [Emotion Sense](http://www.emotionsense.org/)

"Emotion Sense is an Android application that lets you explore how
your mood relates to the data that your smartphone can invisibly
capture as you carry it throughout the day."

## Libraries and Frameworks

### Emotion Sense libs

The Emotion Sense application is built on:

* [ES Sensor Library](https://github.com/nlathia/SensorManager) "An Android Library that offers an easy way to access one-off and publish/subscribe interface to all the smartphone sensors. For more details, check the documentation."
* [ES Data Manager Library](https://github.com/nlathia/SensorDataManager) "An Android Library that allows you to store and bulk transfer sensor (or other application) data, based on the connectivity requirements of your application."
* [ES Trigger Manager Librar](https://github.com/nlathia/TriggerManager) "An Android Library that to notify your application when particular events happen. These triggers can be based on time (e.g., on a particular interval or randomly over a given period) or on sensor events (e.g., a call was received or the phone is moving)."

### [Funf](http://www.funf.org/)

Social and Behavioral Sensing Framework For Android Devices

"The Funf Open Sensing Framework is an extensible sensing and data
processing framework for mobile devices, originally developed at the
MIT Media Lab. The core concept is to provide an open source, reusable
set of functionalities, enabling the collection, uploading, and
configuration of a wide range of data types."

### [MyExperience](http://myexperience.sourceforge.net/)

"MyExperience is a context-aware data collection platform for
capturing objective and subjective data as it's experienced."

Windows Mobile only.
